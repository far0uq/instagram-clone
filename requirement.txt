Things to look out for:

1. Dockerize the application side-by-side.
2. Git Branch for every feature.
3. Careful naming convention ~ use Prettier and ESLint.
4. Review commit changes before committing them.
5. Manage the README.md
->  instructions on how to run and add system dependencies
-> env vars etc(keep it updated as you add dependencies).
-> Readme should also list any and all assumptions
6. Write some seed data to help run the app for the first time(if anyone clones and runs the app).

Dependencies:

1. mongoose -> ODM
2. bcrypt -> Encryption for Passwords
3. express -> backend node framework
4. express-validator -> sanitize inputs etc.
5. config -> easily manage global config data
6. passport.js -> authentication middleware
7. JWT -> mechanism for authentication
8. cloudinary -> image storage
9. dotenv -> for loading configuration data from .env
10. Bootstrap -> Styling

DevDependencies:

1. nodemon -> keeps watching our server [No need to install as included in node v18, --watch]
2. concurrently -> run backend and frontend server at the same time.
